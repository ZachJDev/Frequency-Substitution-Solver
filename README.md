A small tool to assist with solving [substitution ciphers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher). Use it here: https://zachjdev.github.io/Frequency-Substitution-Solver/

## To Use

3. Use the "Replacement Letter" column in the Cipher Text Frequency List table to modify the output

## TO DO
